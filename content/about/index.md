Puckonomics takes a data first approach to hockey analytics. We use understandable analyses and readable articles to answer the questions fans really care about. Whether it's the reasons for your favourite player's midseason slump, dissecting line changes, or analysing comebacks, we let the data do the talking. 

Puckonomics is run by Kate and Daniel, PhD students in Health Economics and Bioinformatics at the University of British Columbia. They love watching hockey, playing with data, and using science to understand what's really going on. We hope you enjoy it!
